			<h2 style="font-family: calibri" >Q1) Do I need to pay to apply to a job or get an interview call? / Recruiters are asking me to pay to schedule interview for job?</h2>
			<p style="font-family: calibri"data-aos="flip-left">No. You can apply to jobs for FREE on Vakarien.<br>Note that genuine recruiters do not ask for money to schedule interviews or offer a job. If you are receiving such calls or emails, beware as this might be a job scam.<br>We regret that sometimes, despite our best efforts, false job postings are listed online, and non-existing job offers are sent via email to illegally collect personal information and/or money from unsuspecting job seekers. Please note that Vakarien.com does not approve of, or represent any employer or recruiter sending such fraudulent communication, which in fact are a violation of the Terms and Conditions. In such cases, we remain vigilant every day - When we receive complaints from Jobseekers about fraudulent or suspicious emails, we promptly notify the concerned employer client and, if necessary, block them from using our services.</p>
			<br>


			<h2 style="font-family: calibri">Q2) I do not want my current employer to have access to my profile. How can I block a recruiter?</h2>
			<p style="font-family: calibri" data-aos="flip-left">You have an option to select companies to whom you do not wish to reveal your resume. Once you have logged in to your account, click on ‘My Profile’ tab visible at the top right corner of the page.<br> On mobile, you can find this in the side menu bar. Click in the above given section. Here, you can search and select the company that you want to block. It may be your current employer or any other company. If you cannot find the company name in the list, search for variants. <br>For example, ABC Private Limited & ABC Pvt. Ltd are variants of the same company name.  Recruiters from the companies selected will not be able to view your profile. We will try our best to conceal you profile from these companies but we cannot guarantee this.</p>
			<br>


			<h2 style="font-family: calibri">Q3) How can I delete my Vakarien account?</h2>
